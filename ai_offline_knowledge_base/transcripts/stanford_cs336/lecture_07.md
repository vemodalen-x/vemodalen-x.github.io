Okay. Let's get started. So, welcome back everyone. So, today we're going to talk about parallelism. And remember in the last week we introduced how to make a single GPU go fast by writing kernels, and we really looked inside this GPU. And this week we're going to talk about how to leverage multiple GPUs to make your code go even faster. Um so, the picture you should have in your head is something like this. So, for the last week we focused on one of these boxes where you have your GPU. Uh remember you have your high bandwidth memory HBM, um L2 cache, L1 cache, registers, and a bunch of streaming multiple uh streaming multiprocessors. Um so, now the picture gets extended because instead of having one GPU, you might have four, you might have a thousand GPUs, and those are going to be

### [01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=60s)

connected. Um and I'll talk later about how those GPUs are going to uh get connected. And then you're going to have to figure out how to leverage all of this compute uh to train models. So, in both cases, meaning both in the single GPU case and in the multi GPU case as we'll talk about today, the situation is kind of similar if you zoom out, which is that the compute um the arithmetic logic uh units, the tensor cores, so on, is far away from your data. And far away for a single GPU means all the way over here in uh HBM. And and now, if you have multiple GPUs, the thing that you need here might be all the way on a different GPU. And you're going to have to shovel uh that over somehow. But the same principles are going to be the same because the game is to orchestrate the computation to try to avoid data transfer bottlenecks. It's very easy to use a ton of GPUs, but it's hard to use them effectively.

### [02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=120s)

So, um taking a little bit of liberty, we can think about the generalized hierarchy where at the at the sort of local level next to the um the SMs is a single node single GPU where you have um an L1 cache shared memory. This was the fastest. And then you had um HPM which we lamented was so slow, but in this lecture HPM is going to be considered fast. Um now we're going to uh think about the single node multi GPU setting where the GPUs are going to be connected via NVLink and NVLink switch. Um and then finally the multi node and multi GPU where we have to resort to InfiniBand and um Ethernet depending on what uh network you have. Okay. So, last week uh we talked about various um tricks for um improving memory accesses, uh fusion, and tiling. Read into shared memory, do

### [03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=180s)

everything you as much as you can, and then write it back out. Um and this week uh we're going to talk about how you can reduce the amount of communication um across uh GPUs by uh replicating and and and sharding appropriately. So, so why do you do GPU multi GPUs? Um the the obvious answer is well, you want to scale, but to put a uh finer point on it, there's really two reasons. One is that your parameters or activations or gradients and optimizer state don't fit on the HPM memory of uh a single GPU. So, B200 has 192 GB. If you're training a 1 trillion parameter model, that's not going to fit on a single uh GPU. And the other reason is that even if your model could fit on single GPU, you might want to leverage more GPUs by uh splitting everything up to train faster. So, sometimes there will be kind of some decisions to be made because

### [04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=240s)

um you could fit everything on GPUs, but you have fewer uh cores. Uh But, if you spread out, then you're going to have to pay the communication bandwidth. Right. So, that's some calculation you're going to have to do to figure out um how to parallelize. Okay. So, just one note here is that um so far this lecture is Python, you execute it, and you can just show everything. Now, this lecture, if you run this directly, it uses multiprocessing. Um but, when I trace through it, I'm putting in some sort of like special single process mode. So, if you want to see the standard out for this lecture, re- um run in the multiprocessing setup, um you can click here, and I'll show this as we go through the lecture. But, just remember as we step through this lecture, we're not actually doing multiprocessing um because we're just stepping through uh single lines of code. Okay. So, this lecture is going to include uh

### [05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=300s)

two parts. One is we're going to learn about the building blocks of distributed communication and computation, um starting with the uh programming model, talk a little bit about the hardware, um start to implement things in torch, um which you're going to um do on your assignment two. And then, the second part is we're going to look at actual uh training. Um we're going to look at three types of parallelism, uh data parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism. Each is going to cut up our model in different ways. We're going to do this for um MLPs, um rather than the full transformer, but it's really um sort of the core computation is going to be uh shown here. Okay. So, let's dive in. So, the first thing to talk about is these things called collective operations. So, collective operations are these uh primitives from distributed programming

### [06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=360s)

that go back to the '80s. So, the idea of parallel programming is is very old. Um it's wasn't invented for LM training. Um and it's it's still the case that these primitives are the ones that we um use um today. And here collective just means that you're specifying a general communication pattern or a template across multiple devices rather than managing um point to point how this GPU is going to communicate with another GPU. And this is going to be much um easier and the system can do a lot more work for you. So, this is um a very tried and true interface for doing parallel uh programming. Okay. So, the general setup is as follows. Um the terminology here is a little bit I find a little bit strange, but this is standard and um in parallel uh programming. The idea is that you have a bunch of ranks, where rank corresponds to a

### [07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=420s)

particular device, in our case a GPU, could be a TPU. But the point is that you have let's say four ranks here. The world size corresponds to the number of devices. So, the world size here is four. Okay. So, there's a few operations we're going to go through. Uh broadcast, scatter, gather, reduce, all gather, reduce, scatter, all reduce, and all to all. And each of these operations is going to specify how this set of ranks or devices is going to transfer some amount of data {slash} compute with it to some other set of devices. So, the first three, broadcast, gather, gather, reduce, are really just warm-ups, I would say. They allow you to get a sense of how these are collective commission collective operations work, but they're not really going to be the ones that are driving most of training. All gather, reduce scatter, and all reduce are the ones that are going to show up again and

### [08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=480s)

again for distributed training of language models. And finally, all to all I'll just mention here, um uh which is important for MOEs, but we're not going to actually spend too much time on this this lecture. Okay, so let's dive in with the simplest operation, which is broadcast. So, in broadcasting, you have a rank zero. It could be any rank, but let's just say for sake of picking one, rank zero, has some tensor 0 1 0 1 2 3, and it broadcasts to all the ranks. So, at the end of this operation, we have that each of the ranks has the same tensor on it. Okay? That should be pretty straightforward. Um and this again doesn't really show up in the that kind of the core path of training. Generally, broadcasts are used for initialization where let's say you

### [09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=540s)

know initialize a load initial checkpoint, and then you want to broadcast it to all the ranks. So, something that's done like once. Okay. So, the second operation is a scatter, and a scatter basically says, I have a tensor at rank zero, whose is split up into the world size, and I'm going to basically scatter my tensor onto the other ranks. So, rank zero gets zero Uh, zeroth component, rank one gets this, rank two gets this, and rank three gets that. Okay? Um, so again, this is not directly used, but um, scatter is a important stepping stone to understand reduce scatter. So, as the name implies, scatter just takes, um, a big tensor at one place and spreads it out on onto multiple places. And you can see how this might be

### [10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=600s)

helpful because you want, uh, all the to uh, GPUs you're scattering to to do some local computation on the different parts. Okay, so the inverse of scatter is gather. Um, so this should be very, uh, predictable. Um, the input is you have a dump for a bunch of pieces, each of which reside on a particular rank. And then when you do gather, that's, um, with respect to a particular rank, rank zero, um, it's going to just concatenate all the pieces together. Okay, again, gather isn't directly used, but it's going to be a stepping stone to understand all gather. So next is, uh, reduce. So, those of you who do, you know, functional programming are probably familiar with reduce is, it's exactly the same. The idea is that you have, you start in the same starting point as a, uh, a gather.

### [11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=660s)

Um, and where the tensor is split up across multiple, well, you have some piece of data on each of the different ranks, and then you're going to apply your reduction operation to all of these and get that in, put that on, uh, rank zero. So in this case, if you, uh, do a reduction with sum, then you add these all up, you get six. Okay? So you can think about gather as a reduction where the the operation is, you know, concatenation if you will. Okay, and of course reduce is important to understanding all reduce. Okay, so let me pause there. Um, those were just kind of the warm-ups just in case people have any questions about what a collective operation is, um, broadcast uh, scatter, gather, reduce.

### [12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=720s)

So, the question is is this related to uh, broadcasting in NumPy? Um, I mean, I think it's the same I conceptually the same idea where you have one thing that goes to many things. Like in NumPy, if you have a scalar get broadcast to a tensor, but um, the instantiation, this is for collective communication, so it's a bit different. Okay, so let's uh, move on to something more interesting. So, all gather is what you do to basically you perform gather to all ranks, not just rank zero. So, remember what gather does? It uh, basically takes all the different pieces and it just puts it on one rank, rank zero. And now all gather just does it for every single rank.

### [13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=780s)

Okay, that's what the all word is for. All means do it for all the output to all the ranks and gather is what you're doing to all the ranks. Okay, so this is going to come up, um, a bunch. Um, it's not important that you understand this statement precisely, but later we'll see that each rank hold part of the parameters and then what you need to do is all gather the parameters to get the full parameters for the full forward pass. So, in general, as we're doing training, we're going to see a lot of this gather to do something and then scatter and then gather and scatter again. Okay. So, reduce scatter is performing reduce on each dimension and then scattering, you know, the results. Okay? So, you have, let's say, you have um of, you know, four uh devices and each of them has some,

### [14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=840s)

you know, vector. And so, when we did a a reduce before, we just had 0 1 2 3 and that got reduced to 6. But now, reduce scatter says that for each component of this tensor, I'm going to do a reduction and then I'm going to put it on a different uh you know, um you know, uh rank. So, um the first dimension, I'm going to add these up, I get six. Um now, for the second dimension, I'm going to add these up, I get 10. For the third dimension, I'm going to process these. For the fourth dimension, I'm going to process those. Okay. So, so where this is going to show up, just as a to foreshadow things, um after the backward pass, when you sum uh the what you're going to do is each uh GPU will be dealing with different

### [15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=900s)

data, right? And what you're doing is you need to sum all of the gradients um from the different, you know, shards and then you're going to distribute redistribute this, you know, storage. Okay. And then finally, all reduce, um if you understand all reduce scatter and all gather, it's basically you do one and then you do the other. Okay. So, what this does is, um, reduce scatter uh, the same input as we had, um, you know, before. And, um, remember in reduce scatter we had 6 10 14 and 18 sit on different ranks. And, uh, the all gather part of all reduce just puts them all on the same everything on the same node. Okay. So, all reduce is in some sense the easiest to understand. You have a bunch of tensors, you reduce, in this

### [16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=960s)

case sum, and then you replicate them on all the nodes. Okay. So, we're going to see this one actually first when we do, uh, data parallel where we sum the gradients, um, and then we replicate the full, uh, your parameters. So, so that's where we're actually going to start. So, maybe just focus your attention on all reduce. Later, we're going to see how, um, to get, uh, to fancier things like, uh, zero or FSDP, we need to break the all reduce into reduce scatter and all gather. Because then you can intervene and you can manage, uh, things a bit more. But, for the basic, uh, version, all reduce is is fine. Okay. Finally, all to all. This one is the, in some ways, the most general. You basically specify how each rank sends, uh, a particular message to another

### [17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1020s)

rank. Um, and so, here's a, you know, simple example where you have the same input as, you know, before. And what this is saying is that I want to send zero to this element to rank, uh, zero. Um, meaning keep it myself. I'm going to send one to rank one, two to rank two, and three to rank three. And then uh for if I'm rank one, I want to send four to rank zero, five to rank one, six to rank two, and uh seven to rank three. So basically, the position here is going to denote where which rank is going to be the ultimate destination. And And so if you look at the output, what happens is that um uh the first rank is going to receive everyone who sent everything in uh column zero because all these ranks are

### [18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1080s)

sending these things to rank zero. Um similarly, for rank one, all of the uh ranks are sending this column to rank one, and so on and so forth. Okay. So, this is going to be useful when um for training MOEs, and the intuition here is that each rank has both a split of the data and also a subset of experts. And basically, you in the key idea of the MOE is that it's sort of dynamic routing. You have to look at your data to figure out which experts um are you need to route that um those activations to. So, it ends up being a all-to-all uh communication. Um so if you look at if everything were balanced, meaning that every rank sent the same number of uh you know, bytes to this to every other rank, then all-to-all, you can

### [19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1140s)

think about it as essentially a transpose. If you think about this as a matrix, all you're doing is transposing that matrix. But in general, all-to-all also handles unbalanced splits. Um and I'm not showing this this here, but you can configure it to send any number of you know bytes to any other another rank. Um but in general you want the splits to be as balanced as possible. So remember Tatsuzou lecture where we had load balancing to make sure that things were as balanced as possible. So morally the ideal goal is to have thing all to all look kind of like this. Okay, so just to summarize maybe a few helpful tips to remember the terminology because I just went through like quite a few different um operations. So reduce is well, it's reduced. It performs on

### [20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1200s)

some sort of associative commutative operation. Could be some, could be max, could be min. Um scatter is the inverse of gather. Scatter distributes, gather centralizes. And all just means that the destination is all you know devices. So that explains all reduce and all gather. Okay, let me pause there to take any questions about collective communications. Yeah, for operations such as like gather and reduce where we like where we like receive like these smaller ranks to rank zero. Is that rank zero the designated like is it like a particular GPU every time or can that rank zero change? Yeah, so the question is when you do a gather or a reduce, the target where you uh write the output, right now I said rank zero. Um

### [21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1260s)

you'll see later in the code you basically specify the the the GPU ID or the the rank. Um and it goes there. So, it doesn't have to be determined like way in advance, but it has to be determined basically when you execute the call. Cool. Anything else? Yeah. These are just like conceptual building blocks or they're not like actually things that like Are they really These two actually represent Yeah, so the question is are these just conceptual building blocks or are they code? So, I'm showing these right now as just conceptual building blocks, but we'll very quickly see how these are implemented in code. Okay, so before getting to the code, um I want to talk a bit about uh the hardware. In particular, how GPUs are

### [22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1320s)

connected because we already know what's inside a GPU. Um So, you know, let's talk about networking um in in general. So, this is kind of a very classic picture. You can tell from this uh very old-looking image um that, you know, this is how computers used I mean, generally work. So, you have this uh you know, server and then you have a bunch of CPUs. There's a PCIE bus um which you connect things like your um or used to connect things like your mouse and and and keyboard. Um and and then you have a bunch of GPUs uh sitting off of them and you have some RAM and then uh this computer is connected to Ethernet to another computer um and so on and so forth. Okay? So, this is a particular setup. It has a particular topology. Um and um you know, GPUs on the same node you use PCIE to communicate and GPUs on

### [23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1380s)

different node you have to go all the way through ethernet. Okay, so this is like if you bought your like gaming GPU and you had, you know, hooked it up with your friend and he's like, "I'm going to train some big model." That's what you would have to do. But, you know, if you're really serious about uh training, then um uh things look more like uh this. This is the picture I showed in the very uh you know, beginning where you have the GPU and there's something called NVLink and NVLink switch and InfiniBand. So, uh the typical uh you know, setup is this. And these numbers, eight is typical, but this 256 is kind of made up. So, typically you have eight uh GPUs per node. Um and these are connected via um Nvidia's NVLink to a switch. Um and just for kind of calibration, if you use NVLink uh five, then you're getting 1.8 terabits uh terabytes per second of

### [24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1440s)

total, you know, bandwidth. And remember, HBM was for B200 was um eight terabytes per second. So, it's you know, about four uh about four x uh slower. So, I mean, this is still pretty fast if you think about um going between devices, but obviously not as fast as uh high bandwidth memory, which is much slower than, you know, shared memory or L1 cache. Okay? So, basically uh NVLink connects to the switch, and which means that um from a programming perspective, you can think about GPUs as connected uh to any other GPU. Right? You go GPU to any other GPU, and the hardware takes care of um transmitting that to the switch and then the switch routes it. Okay, so typically what you will also have is that at some point, you uh you can't have NV switch and NV link and you

### [25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1500s)

have to because what as your clusters you know, the number of GPUs grows, then you're going to have to put these nodes into pods or which are connected by InfiniBand. And the way InfiniBand works is that now there's a bit you know, more the so now the the GPU doesn't connect directly to another GPU, it has to go through PCI E and uh and goes through this kind of special InfiniBand cable and you see that the the you know, the speeds are much much lower. And then finally, if you run out of InfiniBand and you have these like huge pods, um you know, then you need to connect them via you know, Ethernet. And in Ethernet, um you know, you have to go through PCI E and that actually goes through this your CPU, which as we'll see is um you know, even even slower.

### [26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1560s)

Okay, so it's kind of analogous to the kind of memory situation. The more nodes uh you have, then the slower it's going to be. You can't have like a NV switch handling like 100,000, you know, GPUs. So, one note is that this I mentioned alluded to this bypassing the CPU, which is is going to be uh an important thing from a hardware perspective. Um so, if you have traditional Ethernet, you know, what happens is that the GPU has to talk to the CPU to get its uh data copied. So, it basically has to copy the data uh to this uh the CPU has a kernel socket buffer. Here is kernel means you know, not the GPU kernel, but the uh the CPU traditional notion of a kernel, um and then it has to build some uh some network packets, copy to the network interface, and then ship it over. So,

### [27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1620s)

this generally introduces a lot of latency. And so, there's this technology called Remote Direct Memory Access, RDMA, which allows a GPU to directly write or read from another uh GPU's memory without using the CPU at all. So, obviously, if you're in NVLink land and NV Switch land, then you have RDMA. Um InfiniBand also supports RDMA. So, if you're connected via InfiniBand, then you can directly uh have GPUs connect to each other without access uh involving the CPU. Uh but standard Ethernet uh does not. Um there's two notable advancements I will mention is that uh um So, NVIDIA has been really pushing the limits on what you can do with larger and larger, you know, pods. So, they have for the basically the B200s and the um B300s, they have something called NVL72,

### [28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1680s)

which means that they they have these uh trays of eight GPUs, but have nine of them. And so, basically, at the end of the you have 72 GPUs that are all kind of NV switched into one NVLink domain. And if you remember um the NVLink uh you know, speeds are very fast. Right? So, normally, um if you're if you're, you know, mortal, you think, "Well, okay, I have eight GPUs that are interlinked really fast, and then outside of that, you know, then things get slowed down a lot." But if you have a lot of money, you can buy this uh really fancy hardware, and you can get uh really fast interconnects up to 72 um GPUs. And the other thing I'll mention is that, you know, I said standard Ethernet doesn't support RDMA, but there has been progress on the Ethernet front as well. So, there's something called um RoCE, RDMA over a converged Ethernet,

### [29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1740s)

where the Ethernet actually bypasses the the CPU, um and this is sort of their their answer to InfiniBand. So, InfiniBand generally is very ex- expensive, as is, you know, a lot of NVIDIA uh products. Um but uh you can get, you know, pretty good performance by using um um using uh RDMA over converged Ethernet. And uh Meta had some papers showing that they were use exploring this. So, uh Llama may or may not have been trained over uh converged Ethernet. Okay. So, that's just a kind of brief overview of what the the hardware uh looks like. You have GPUs. They're connect via NVLink to a NV uh switch over some domain, maybe eight, maybe 72, and then it's InfiniBand uh from there. And now,

### [30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1800s)

let's talk about, you know, how do you program this? So, at the very lowest level, there's something called the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library, uh NCCL or NCCL, which translates the collective operations, the all reduce, uh reduce, broadcast, into the actual low-level packets that are sent between GPUs. So, what uh NCCL does is it um when you when you use NCCL, it's basically like saying, "I want to all reduce." And then NCCL goes and figures out what is the topology of the hardware, figures out the the path between different GPUs, and then it actually launches the GPU kernels to send and receive data. Because at the end of the day, remember everything that runs on the GPU is is a kernel. So, there are communication kernels as well that actually do uh you know, communication with other GPUs. Okay, so we're not going to look too too much more into uh nickel, but just know

### [31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1860s)

that it exists. Um and then we're going to actually go to PyTorch. So, maybe before that, any questions about you know, hardware? Yeah. Can you like describe Is there anything like a rack Uh Can I describe physically a rack and a tray? Like what a rack is and what a tray is? Uh so, for the NV uh 72, so I'm not I'm not a hardware expert, but uh but a rack, I mean, is literally like I mean, I've I've you've seen data centers like where you have like a rack and each tray is uh something that has So, it's So, G the G stands for a grace. So, there's you know, two CPUs and each CPU is connected to four GPUs. So, each tray has um eight uh GPUs on it and they're stacked and everything, you know, is connected to

### [32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1920s)

this, you know, um NV switch. Yeah. Who is responsible for this one? Yeah, so the question is what is the difference between our DMA and this? Yeah, so RDMA you can think about it as a more of a uh a digital router. RDMA means that like one GPU can read and write from another GPU's memory. And there's multiple ways to do RDMA. One is to use NVLink and NV Switch. And another way is to use InfiniBand. So, InfiniBand and NV Switch and NVLink are more of the the hardware. Like what what pieces like what cables are are and switch is are there. And RDMA is more um operationally like what what happens

### [33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=1980s)

when you're communicating. Yeah, for example, there's an advance that uh uh RDMA over converged Ethernet is another way to do RDMA. So, the question is is nickel optimized for multi- node clusters. Um So, my

### [34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2040s)

So, I don't know the details of how you know, they have or have not optimized it. All I can say is that, you know, NVIDIA has been basically you know, optimizing the entire stack for, you know, inference and training of these large um models because their main customers are the kind of major um you know, providers of language models. So, I would be surprised if they haven't thought of uh optimizing for those type of workloads. So, uh question is what happens if you have nine GPUs? How do you distribute the workload across those? Um I I suppose I guess it kind of depends on how the nine lands in your your setup. For

### [35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2100s)

example, a lot of times you'll have um you know, let's say you have eight GPUs per node. So, then the ninth one would be on a different node. And if you don't have um you know, NVLink connecting them, then that's going to be really bad because that's going to be one node which is not providing that much compute and also very expensive to communicate with. Um but if you let's say had a um everything were connected by NVLink, you know, switch, then it would be um much more reasonable. Okay. Um one more question and I'm going to move on. Yeah. TPUs? So, how is this different from uh TPUs? Um so, how to describe TPUs a bit uh more. So, um I mean, the let's see. Um what can I say quickly about this? Um so, TPUs are generally kind of much

### [36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2160s)

uh you know, simpler objects. Um I'm not too familiar with the details of how this like what this each of these components corresponds to, but maybe we can talk about it offline. Okay. So, let's actually get down to some code to um take advantage of this this hardware. So, PyTorch conveniently has a torch.distributed library that provides a clean interface into these collective operations. So you don't have to explicitly think about nickel um And in fact, this library also supports different backends for different hardware. So if you are on GPUs, then you would use the nickel backend. And if you are on CPUs, then there's something called glue, which uh still allows you to you know, like I said, parallel processing has been around for um you know, a long time before GPUs, and you can do um these collective operations on CPUs as well. Um

### [37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2220s)

This library also supports higher-level models and algorithms such as uh uh SFTP, but we're not going to use those in the course because we're building things from scratch. All right. So let's walk through some basic examples of collective operations. Um so this this function called uh spawn, which takes uh another function I'm going to call, and it says, "I'm going to run this uh replicated four times, where four is the world size." So let's see what this does. Um this is actually a wrapper I wrote um just to sort of hack around the fact that I can't do multiprocessing in this uh this lecture. So normally, what you would do is you call uh um you know, torches.multiprocessing.spawn, then you call the function. Um but you know, I'm going to do this branch, which dis- dis- disables distributed. So let's

### [38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2280s)

just go through that. So now um now I'm in this uh function that it's supposed to be running on asynchronously for each process. So remember, world size is the number of processes, and the rank is either zero or one or two all the way up to world size minus one. And so there are world size number of these functions that are or each running on a process at the same time. Okay, so I'm on uh rank zero right now. So, what do I do? Um there's a setup. Um you basically configure uh the the master address and port. Um notice that this is not actually how the the GPUs are going to communicate. This is more for just general metadata and coordination. So, data goes through nickel. Otherwise, it'll be very very slow. Um and if you have CUDA available, then you can use the nickel back end. Um I'm on my laptop, so I'm going to use uh the

### [39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2340s)

glue back end. Okay, so um so, now I'm here. I'm running um you know, pretend I have four of these processes running. Um so, there's this uh barrier function, which um is useful as uh it's a synchronization barrier. So, basically, if I see this, then it waits for all the processes to get to this point. Um okay? So, basically, you can think of all the processes are running asynchronously. Um so, I don't really control one could completely finish before the other. They might uh finish be interleaving anyway. So, if I want to make sure that certain there's some code that is executed before other code, I put these uh synchronization barriers in. So, now the downside of putting more barriers in is that, well, you end up kind of waiting uh potentially unnecessarily.

### [40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2400s)

Okay, so let's try an all reduce. Okay, so I'm going to um create this tensor 0 1 2 3. And um I have my rank. Just to make it more interesting, each rank is uh going to have a different tensor. Um I'm going to print out what I have before the all reduce. So, now I'm going to skip over here and see what gets printed out. Um so, uh rank zero before all reduce has 0 1 2 3. Um rank one has 1 2 3 4 and so on. It's the same example as I showed before. Notice that the print statements are coming in whatever order uh the hardware feels like it because it's running a sync, but all the data is there. Okay. So, now if I do a all reduce and uh this you pass in This is a PyTorch function. It passes in this this tensor. You pass in the

### [41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2460s)

reduction operation, which is a sum. And I'm going to say don't do it uh a sync. And what this does is it calls um in this case it would be glue, but it could be nickel. And which in which case it would spin up the the CUDA kernels. It would do the communication. It takes care of everything for you. And then it basically writes in place to the data. So, after the all reduce um I have the all reduce operation. Remember, which is the sum of each of these columns, but replicated across all the ranks. Okay. So, so that's you know, all reduce. And if you want to do be you know, fancier and do a sync, then you could say a sync equals true. But then it would screw up all these print statements. So, I'm trying to put more barriers than I would normally would.

### [42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2520s)

Uh so, the question is the rank of the GPU. Uh for this class, the rank is uh the GPU. Yes. Okay, so let's try another example here. So I'm going to do a reduced scatter. So here I'm going to create an input which is zero through the the world size. And I'm going to have the the output. I'm going to allocate the output. And so what does this look like before I do the reduced scatter? It looks like let's see this where each it's kind of the same you know input and the output is happens to

### [43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2580s)

be zeros but it could be you know just anything. And then I do the reduced scatter tensor. Here instead of writing in place I have a output tensor and an input tensor. I say I want to you know do the sum. And then afterwards I get basically the input is not touched but the output I get the the reduction of each component written into the respective ranks. Yeah, so the question is how does it work to do the all reduces asynchronous? So what this means is that this this is sort of like a monolithic operation. You

### [44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2640s)

say go do the all reduce and it's spinning up you know know, kernels. It's going to you know, do the communication. And uh remember CUDA is already kind of a sync um with respect to the process processes, and now we have all the processes being a sync. And the point is that um this code just would return. Um and and then you could do kind of other things. So, a typical thing um which I'm not going to have uh talk about this class is overlapping computation and communication. Uh so, for example, you can do this um operation, and then you can go ahead and load some other data for the next uh step. Um which is independent of this operation. And then when you want to make sure that you actually um are done, then you can call wait or a a barrier.

### [45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2700s)

Okay. So, let's do the final one, which is all gather. So, by now, I think you kind of get the idea. Here, I'm going to set as the input the output of the reduce scatter. Um I'm going to allocate an output. Uh so, before the all gather, it looks like this. I have my uh result from the reduce scatter here. Um the output is uh you know, it just allocated, happens to have some values in it, but don't you know, worry uh about it. Um And then um after I do the all gather into tensor, um and then I will have um you know, all the different uh inputs uh you know, gathered onto all the different ranks. Okay? And you can see here that indeed

### [46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2760s)

uh proof via example that all reduce is equal to reduce scatter plus all gather. Okay. And then um just to wrap things up, just as I started by a setup then I clean up um which, you know, uh just um it's good practice to clean up. Okay. So so that was your first example of a torch uh distributed, you know, program. Okay. So, let's do um some um you know, benchmarking. Uh this will be quick since I want to actually move on to the uh part two. Um so, how fast does communication happen? So, let's do an all reduce. Um so, here I'm going to all reduce with

### [47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2820s)

you know, 100 million um elements. And oops. Okay. So, all reduce So, I'm going to create uh you know, this this tensor with this number of elements, call um and remember just like before when we do benchmarking, we warm up first. Um and here I'm going to call the CUDA synchronize and also the the barrier um just to make sure that because there's two forms of asyncrony here, the CUDA kernels and the different processes, and just want to make sure everything is kind of uh not running in the um is is done um before I start the time and I'm going to do the all reduce um and and then uh wait uh again with the synchronizing the barrier, and stop the

### [48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2880s)

time. Okay, so remember this is running for every single rank. So, if I look at the output here, for rank 0 2 1 3, I have a different time potentially because they're all different processes. Each of them is going to report a certain um you know, measurement. And if you want to report one number, you can take the average, for example. Um So, now, one thing that is useful to do, which is analogous to when we were computing MFU, is to compute measure the effective bandwidth. And the idea here is that well, this took 1.6 milliseconds. You know, how much um you know, is that good or bad? So, to compute the effective bandwidth, what we're going to do is to compute essentially how much how many bytes were

### [49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=2940s)

sent and should be sent kind of during this computation. Um and then you if you divide by the total time, then you get the bad effective bandwidth. Okay, so um the size of what I'm sending around is the the size of each element times the number of elements, so that's the basically the number of bytes of this data tensor. Um how many bytes get actually sent? So, this uh needs some unpacking. So, for all reduce, um if you think about, let's just say for simplicity, you do a rank 0 plus rank 1 plus rank 2 plus rank 3, um you need to iterate this world size minus one steps because there's a world size minus one, you know, addition operations. The So, that's this factor. There's a two because you need to both kind of send and reduce. So, and then you multiply by the size of the payload. So, that's the total number of sent

### [50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3000s)

bytes. And the total duration um is the the time that the wall clock time that it took. And then you multiply by the the world size um because it's like the total amount that the all the ranks have waited. And the bandwidth is the the um the bytes sent divided by the total, you know, duration. Okay, so in this case, uh you get something like, you know, about 400 GB uh you know, per second. Okay? So, one uh a few notes here. One is that the effective bandwidth, if you look at this expression, size * 2 * world size - 1 / world size * duration, so as world size increases, this uh world my size - 1 / world size essentially converges to one. So, you're

### [51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3060s)

effectively left with two times the size bytes over the duration. So, this is essentially uh the bandwidth. Notice that this is independent of the world size, which is which is good. So, if you grow the number of GPUs you have, you are still, you know, the bandwidth doesn't, you know, change. It is also independent of the topology, which is something that kind of nickel uh you know, figures out whether you're um going to uh pass the messages in a kind of a ring or a tree topology. Um so, yeah. Okay, so that is uh all reduce. And for reduce scatter, um this is very similar. Um so, I'm going to create the inputs and the outputs, warm up, uh perform the operation, and time it. So, uh notice that the reduce scatter has uh this um these timings. Um

### [52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3120s)

And and you can also measure the effective bandwidth here. The number of bytes uh that were uh in the input, you have the number of bytes that were sent. Here there is no um you know, 2x here. Um and then the total duration, you divide by that, you get the bandwidth. So, here the bandwidth is uh um it should be very similar. I guess sometimes there's some stochasticity, but it's on in the kind of 400s. So, a few notes here. A all reduce is, remember as we stated, reduce scatter plus an all gather. And so, all reduce naturally is moving twice the amount of data um because reduce scatter is like has some cost, all gather has some cost, and all reduce is doing twice as much work.

### [53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3180s)

Um but and it takes twice the amount of time. Um but you know, the two cancel out, so you get the the same kind of bandwidth. Okay. All right. So, um that is the end of part one. Maybe any questions before I move to part two? So, why do we have to do the synchronize for the CUDA kernel? So, at the end of the day, we are still doing CUDA operations. Right? We have just multiple processes, each with a GPU, um doing some CUDA operations. And then, so if you're doing a CUDA operation, remember by default it's

### [54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3240s)

async. So, when you reach the next line in Python, that CUDA operation might not be done. So, we need to wait always until that's to make sure it's done by synchronizing. Yeah. So, do you have to do barrier first and then synchronize? Um not sure. Yeah. Yeah, I think one problem is if you barrier first and then the CUDA might not be done running and you just immediately go to the barrier. And then, you are still kind of each independently synchronizing the different CUDA kernels. Which means that you're not really synchronized. Um like the barrier might

### [55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3300s)

if all those uh operations just return, the barrier doesn't really do any thing. Okay, let me move on. So, now let's actually start thinking about how you train models. Okay? So, we're just going to walk through a very bare-bones implementation of training MLPs, multi-layer MLPs. Um I guess that's redundant. It's multi-layer perceptrons already. Um and remember that MLPs are the ones that are the actual compute bottleneck in a transformer, so this is actually pretty representative of what you'll see. Okay. So, data uh parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism. And the picture I want to uh you to have in your head is this picture. So, um this is a little bit of a schematic, so don't think too deeply about this, but it's more of a way to conceptualize how you're cutting um your data and parameters. So, data parallelism says, "I'm going to

### [56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3360s)

split the data into pieces, and then each of the GPUs is going to be responsible for part of the data, and I'm going to do just do normal uh you know, I'm going to act keep track of all the parameters and do model normal model, you know, training." Um and then I need to synchronize. So, let me explain how this how this works. So, I'm going to generate some sample data. So, there's a batch size of 128, number of dimensions 1,024. So, this is a batch size by num dim uh matrix data matrix. And uh let's jump into this uh data parallelism. Okay? So, the way that it's going to work is that you have this data matrix, and I'm going to break up the rows into a bunch of um into num world size pieces,

### [57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3420s)

in this case four, and each uh rank is going to get a piece. Okay? So, the number of dimensions, the batch size, um so, each I'm going to call the local batch size, basically um you know, the batch size divided by the world size, which is every row is going to have that uh GPU sees is going to have 32 um you know, data points. Um and this is just indexing start index uh data start to end gets you the slice of that data and I'm going to just put it on that um on that rank. Okay, so at this point each GPU has now a distinct data tensor which is the part that they're uh responsible for. Now in practice uh each rank should probably load its own data rather have this you know this bottleneck but um this is just for illustrative purposes.

### [58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3480s)

Okay, so let's uh instantiate the the MLP. So here I'm uh assume we have num layers um and uh num layers uh and for each of the layers I'm going to have just a num dim by num dim um matrix. Um so I'm just going to initialize a random you know set of parameters. Um and then um I'm going to feed that into optimizer. Okay? So here's the training loop. So in the forward pass I take the data. So remember data is not the all the data. It's just um if I'm rank two then I only get B2 part of the data. I'm going to just you know go through the number of layers and uh do a forward pass. And then I'm going to do a backward pass.

### [59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3540s)

And then normally this would be it. But um now remember every rank has different data. Therefore, the gradients are going to be you know different as well. So this is the key uh step that makes uh data parallelism work. We're going to synchronize the gradients across all the workers. This is only difference between standard training and DDP. It's actually pretty nice and elegant. So basically for all the parameters, I'm going to do a all reduce of um param.grad. And I'm going to average. Um and then after this all reduce is done, then now at this point, each of the ranks has the exact same gradients. And then I'm just going to update uh the the parameters.

### [01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3600s)

Okay? So, it's kind of really kind of elegant I find because it's basically standard training where are you apply it to your local batch, but um you just insert this after the backward pass. Let's just, you know, average all the gradients via this all reduce. It's a one-line, you know, uh code change. And then the parameters get updated. So, as you're training, each um rank is basically performing parameter updates as if it were have all the data on it, but it's only actually processing a part of the data. Okay. So, that's uh basically uh DDP or um the first type of data parallel. Any questions about this? So, the question is can you only do this with batch size greater than one? Uh yes. So, your batch size has to be at

### [01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3660s)

least world size for this to really make sense. And usually it should probably be quite a bit larger. Yeah. So, the question is should the um batch size be a multiple of world size? And that's also would be nice. Yes. I mean, if it's not, then you can pad it with zeros or something. So, there's ways, but it's just easier for everyone if it is. Uh yeah, so the question is what it would this look like for a transformer? It would actually be basically the the same. The DDP has a nice thing that is very modular. You do the forward pass. I mean, DDP just averages the parameters here. It doesn't care what your forward

### [01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3720s)

pass looks like. Okay. Let me move on. Okay, so that's DDP. Um so, just to summarize, the losses are different across the ranks. Um the gradients are also, you know, initially different, but they're all reduced to be the same across the ranks, and therefore the parameters all remain the same across ranks. Okay. So, next lecture Tatsu is going to talk about fancier uh data parallelism, FSDP and zero, and the idea there is, as I've alluded to, here we use all reduce. It's like a very simple monolithic operation, but it does require holding all the models parameters in memory. But what if the model parameters don't fit in memory? Then you're going to have to be more clever, and that's the topic for next class. Okay.

### [01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3780s)

So, let me talk about tensor parallelism. So, here the idea is we're going to cut this way. I mean, we're not going to cut the data, we're going to cut um the essentially uh each layer. And so, each rank is going to get part of each layer. Okay? And generally this rem- means that we're going to have to transfer a a lot more more data. We're going to discuss this a bit later. Um So what does tensor parallel look like? Okay. So um we're just going to assume we have this data. Every rank has all the data um just for simplicity. And here, remember the the data is batch size times num dim. And I'm going to define a local num dim to be for this uh rank, I only am

### [01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3840s)

um responsible for a subset of the the dimensions. So uh the kind of the picture here is that um each model still has all the layers here for all the layers, but the parameters now are num dim times uh local num dim. Okay? So if this were one of the parameter matrices for one layer, um I would be doing um splitting down uh the columns. Okay? So this is also known as column uh you know, tensor parallel. You can also do it by rows, but we're not going to talk about that right now. Okay. So now what does the forward pass uh look like? So go through all the layers and I'm going to compute activations. So um I start with uh you know, X, the data.

### [01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3900s)

And I'm going to access the parameters at layer uh layer. And notice that this is only a slice of the the right? So if I'm on rank one, I only get this part of uh the matrix. But, you know, I can still proceed. I can apply this non-linearity because this is element-wise anyway. Uh but now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to um you know, communicate activations. So, if I have a data matrix, rank one has activations for part of the activations uh for this part of the matrix. Um rank one has part of the activations for this matrix, and so on and so forth. And I need to basically put all the activations on all the um the ranks. And but we know how to do that. We introduced all gather as a collective uh primitive. So, I have

### [01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=3960s)

This is all the the activations. Um so, this is um you know, the batch size times local num um dim, which is the shape of the of the activations. Um and then I'm doing a all gather. Um Sorry. So, this is the allocating memory for the activations. So, X is the actual part of the activation. So, this is batch size times local num dim. And all gather says each rank has X, and each uh rank is going to allocate activations, um uh which is a list, one for each world size. And then after the all gather, X is going to be copied into each of the respective location activations. Okay. So, then um once I gather all the activations, I concatenate them to form the full uh dimensional X, which is

### [01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4020s)

batch size times num dim. Okay. Um any questions about column tensor parallel? So, this is done for every layer. Um we've Now, notice one difference between uh data parallel is now we have to kind of muck around with the model. Data parallel is very elegant because it's splitting by data. The model is treated as a as a module. Uh but now we have to muck around with a model. Um and you know, this is sort of strongly leveraging the fact that if you want to do a matrix multiplication, you can split it up into a set of small matrix small smaller matrix multiplications. You can do those on different ranks, and then we can gather the the results.

### [01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4080s)

Yeah, so so now the question is what happens in back prop. Now, in the back prop, you have your your activations, and you have to uh reduce uh scatter to all the different um you know, gradients. So, in some ways, all gather and reduce scatter have this kind of duality where in forward, if you're all gathering in the backward, you're reduce scattering. Yeah. So, the question is is that done automatically by autograd? So, none of this Well, okay. So, if you just call dot backward, it's not going to do it because there's no parallelism in that, but you know, PyTorch has all these things that are done automatically for you. So, um

### [01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4140s)

>> So, in this So, what hack is done for U and versus automatically? Um here we're managing things fairly explicitly. So, which means I'm not doing the backward pass, but you would have to manage and call the the reduce scatter yourself. Yeah. And that's baked in by design because this is 336 uh you know, building language models from scratch. In practice, you probably wouldn't have to do that. Okay. So, let's do pipeline parallelism uh quickly. So, the idea behind pipeline parallelism is we're going to split the network this way. So, each um rank is going to get a subset of the layers now. Within each layer, it's going to get all the the dimensions. And it's also going to get all the um well,

### [01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4200s)

the one of the ranks is going to get all the data. Um it will it's going to every rank is going to see all the data in some form. Um so, this is the the way it's going to work. Um Okay. So, let's um we have all the data, which is again uh the batch size times num dim. Um and I'm going to split up the layers. So, local num layers is going to be the number of layers that a particular rank is going to handle. Um and and so, I'm now I'm going to have local params uh which is basically only there's local number of layers number of them. But, within each layer, I'm going to do the you know, num dim by num dim. Okay. So, um one thing I um maybe Tatsu will talk more about this on uh Wednesday is this idea of micro batches. Um, so maybe I'll just present this and

### [01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4260s)

explain why I'm doing things this way. So, in addition to splitting up the layers, I'm also going to split up the batch into a bunch of micro batches. Um, so if I'm rank zero, then I get the data. Um, and I'm going to chunk it up into number of micro batches. Um, and for each um, you know, micro batch, what I'm going to do is uh, receive it from the previous rank. Um, and then do the feed forward pass only on the layers that are assigned to this rank. And then I'm going to send to the next, uh, you know, rank. Okay, so here I'm actually using these receive and send, which are point-wise operations. I So, I didn't cover those before, but they're fairly,

### [01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4320s)

um, explanatory. This basically says I'm rank, and I'm going to send this tensor over to, um, you know, uh, oh, sorry. I'm going to receive this tensor from rank minus one. Um, and this says I'm going to send tensor X to rank plus one. Um, okay. So, so basically the reason why um, I'm talking about micro batches is, uh, and Toshi will talk more about this, uh, on Wednesday, is that in pipeline parallelism, so you have one rank that gets the data. It processes some of the layers, and then it sends it to the next, um, you know, GPU, and it processes some of the layers and it then it sends it to the next GPU. Right? So, this is a very natural way of dividing our deep network, but the

### [01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4380s)

problem is that you get these what are called pipeline bubbles where um, while you're not um, sort of processing, you're kind of waiting around for other tensors to process. And this is ends up being quite inefficient. So, the idea behind uh, micro batches is that you break it up into smaller batches so you can kind of process it quickly, send it on to the next one. So, this can reduce the number of uh, pipeline now bubbles. Okay, so the other thing I will mention that is not handled in this very kind of naive version is the idea of overlapping communication and computation, which is actually very important to pipeline parallelism. This basically gives you the right structure. If you put a I uh, before these, then it becomes um, kind of async. Um, you you have to add more things to kind of manage the the uh, the code. Um, and the idea here is

### [01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4440s)

that you want to be while you're computing here, um, you should you know, you can be receiving um, data or sending data. So, computation and communication should be overlapped so uh, that reduces amount of time um, you're actually spent waiting. Okay. So, a few things that are kind of um, you know, missing here, uh, which will uh, hopefully fill in next time. So, the communication versus computation overlap, which is uh, especially crucial in pipeline parallelism. Um, I didn't mention uh, in data parallelism this also um, happens because I just did a full repass and then at the end I'm just doing all these all reduces. But if you're clever, then on the backward pass, as soon as the gradients are done, you can start sending that. And that's something you'll be exploring

### [01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4500s)

in the assignment two. And this again allows you to just, you know, overlap communication and computation, um, more. Um, we had some questions about what about general models? Again, I think this um, MLP gives you essentially all you um, you know, mostly of most of kind of what you need for understanding the, you know, the basics. Um, some of the larger models just require a lot more bookkeeping, so um, it's harder to kind of see the core core algorithms. Um, there are other types of parallelism that we haven't covered. Um, so sequence parallelism takes a whole, you know, sequence and chops it up into pieces and that allows you to parallelize attention computation, expert parallelism, which, um, allows you to parallelize, uh, the experts for MOEs and this is where the all-to-all that I mentioned comes in. And then also, you know,

### [01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4560s)

uh, you know, different combinations of, uh, different parallelization techniques, which also will show up in the assignment. Um, so one thing to note is that the which parallelism technique you choose is going to be strongly dependent on the hardware. For example, tensor parallelism, there's a lot of communication because for every layer you're just, you know, you need to send all these activations which are fairly big. So generally tensor parallelism happens within a node on NVLink or NV, uh, where you have high bandwidth. Um, whereas you wouldn't do tensor parallelism the kind of an NVLink uh, you know domain. Um whereas uh pipeline parallelism, you'll see people using it and generally this is can tolerate much uh you know slower you know uh interconnects. So, some of the decentralized um training

### [01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4620s)

work uses pipeline parallel because your you know nodes are GPUs are actually across halfway across the world. Um but you wouldn't want to do tensor parallel in that that setting. Um so, sometimes you when you look at these combinations, it'll be tensor parallel within a node and then um and then uh you know pipe data parallel or SFDP and then um and then uh you know pipeline parallelism if you if you need it. Um there's other effects such as if you do data parallel, you might be able to do data parallel uh quite a bit, but then you start hitting to something called the critical batch fact uh size where if you start increasing the batch size too much, it doesn't actually help you, in which case you're just kind of wasting your compute and then you're better off using tensor parallel. So, there's a bunch of these considerations which um we'll talk more about as we uh go through the class.

### [01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4680s)

Um so, final note uh so, TPUs kind of came up a little bit. Um one thing to to note is that on purpose, we are using PyTorch and not just using PyTorch, but really using the collective uh operations in a very primitive way. So, you can see uh mechanically what's happening. Another approach, uh especially if you're JAX and TPU land, is that you can simply define the model and the starting strategy and the compiler actually handles a lot of um the the decision of how to basically what kind of communicated operations you need. You basically say, well, this piece of data needs to be here and here and here and then the compiler does some magic to figure out what. So, that's appealing but, you know,

### [01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4740s)

obviously it would take a lot of the you know, the joy out of actually building things from scratch. Okay. Uh just to summarize. So, there's many ways to parallelize. You can cut by data, cut by tensor, or expert, cut by pipeline, or sequence. We looked at data parallelism. We only did DDP. Next time we'll do FSDP and zero. Tensor parallelism, as I mentioned, requires very fast internet connects. Pipeline, less so. But you need to really work hard to reduce these pipeline you know, bubbles. And then maybe at a high level we see this kind of pattern come up a lot. Right? So, you can either recompute or store in memory. When we were talking about things like activation checkpointing or

### [01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzpOcwdIL0Y&t=4800s)

doing you know, when we're working with GPUs. Or in this case, you can think about an extension of this is that you can store on a different you know, GPU. Right? From that perspective, you look at the data parallel. Right? You're doing redundant work. In some sense, because every you know, rank is actually updating its parameters and keeping track of all the parameters. But the reason you're doing that is that you don't have to move the optimizer state across. Um So, you know, one thing is that, you know, hardware is getting, you know, faster, but in some sense, we'll always want, you know, bigger models. So, this idea of having a hierarchical structure will, you know, always be there. Okay, so that's it for today. So, uh next Wednesday, Tatsuo will uh do more of a deep dive on uh more parallelism techniques. Okay.
